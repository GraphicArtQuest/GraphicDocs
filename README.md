# JSDoc For Python
A JSDoc style annotation method for Python scripts

## About

Inspired by the [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) style for documenting Javascript code.

This project makes use of JSDOc style comments within Python docstrings combined with annotations to create better documentation for Python projects. Your Python scripts are parseable so you can write your own formatting code, or you can use the provided Markdown generator (in progress).

This project is neither sponsored nor endoresed by the JSDoc team.
